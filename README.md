# DistilBERT-Sentiment

This repository contains all data for analzying the sentiment and complexity of earnings repors and news articles of 15 selected Swiss companies.

**File description:**

**German_BERT_model_Alexander_Schlaubitz.ipynb** -> this file is used to train the DistilBERT model for sentiment classification and complexity formulas are implemented

**ANN_Alexander_Schlaubitz.ipynb **-> this file assesses stock prediction accuracy with and without sentiment
**
LSTM_stock_price_Alexander_Schlaubitz.ipynb** -> this file tries to predict stock price development using an LSTM, however no convergence

**
all_news_articles_and_earnings_reports.xlsx **-> Overview of all gathered news articles and earnigns reports
